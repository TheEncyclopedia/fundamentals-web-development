# Web programming fundamentals

Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites or web applications. It encompasses a wide range of activities, from:

- **Designing the structure and layout of the website:** This involves defining how the information will be organized and presented on the web page.
- **Writing code**: Web developers use various programming languages, like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to build the website's functionality and interactivity.
- **Connecting the website to the internet**: This involves setting up servers and databases to store and manage the website's content.
- **Ensuring the website is user-friendly and accessible**: This includes making sure the website is easy to navigate and works on different devices.

Web development can be as simple as creating a static website with a single page of information, or as complex as building a large-scale web application with multiple features and functionalities.
