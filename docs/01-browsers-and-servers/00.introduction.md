# Introduction to Web Browser

**A web browser** is a client-side application that requests, interprets, and displays content from servers over the internet—primarily HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, as well as images, videos, and other resources. Popular browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, and Opera.

From a software engineer’s perspective, a browser is:

- **A key part of the web development stack:** it fetches resources via HTTP/HTTPS, executes JavaScript, applies CSS, and presents a rendered page.
- **An execution environment:** the browser’s JavaScript engine provides essential APIs for DOM manipulation, network requests (fetch, WebSockets), storage (localStorage, IndexedDB), and more.
- **A debugging and performance testing environment:** modern browsers ship with developer tools that allow real-time inspection of network requests, page elements, performance metrics, security issues, and more.

## Core Browser Components

Modern browsers are complex systems composed of multiple modules. At a high level, the important components include:

**1. User Interface (UI):**
    - The UI includes the address bar (URL bar), back/forward buttons, bookmarks, refresh, etc.
    - It also comprises interfaces like the developer tools panel, settings, and other user-facing browser windows.
**2. Browser Engine (Controller):**
    - Manages actions between the UI and the rendering engine.
    - Handles resource loading logic and orchestrates communication with the networking layer.
**3. Networking layer:**
    - Manages network calls using standard protocols (HTTP, HTTPS).
    - Handles caching, cookies, and other HTTP-related mechanisms (e.g., keep-alive, TLS, HTTP/2, or HTTP/3).
    - Works with the OS-level networking stack to make secure or insecure connections.
**4. Rendering engine:**
    - Interprets HTML and CSS, builds the DOM (Document Object Model) and the CSSOM (CSS Object Model), and merges them into a “render tree.”
    - Performs layout calculations (e.g., how elements flow, their positions and sizes).
    - Carries out painting operations (e.g., compositing layers, drawing text, images, backgrounds) to produce pixels on the screen.
    - Examples of rendering engines: Blink (Chrome, Edge, Opera), WebKit (Safari), Gecko (Firefox).
**5. JavaScript engine:**
    - Executes JavaScript code in a secure sandboxed environment. Examples: V8 (Chrome, Edge, Opera), SpiderMonkey (Firefox), JavaScriptCore (Safari).
    - Performs optimizations like just-in-time (JIT) compilation for faster execution.
**6. Data storage:**
    - Browsers support multiple storage mechanisms:
        - Cookies (small key-value data attached to requests, limited in size).
        - localStorage / sessionStorage (key-value, synchronous, limited storage).
        - IndexedDB (asynchronous NoSQL-like database for structured data).
        - Cache Storage (used by service workers to cache application assets).
